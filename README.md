Blur

Edge Detection

Sharpen

Pencil Sketch

âœ… Resize the image by entering width and height

âœ… Save the processed image in PNG, JPG, or other formats

**Prerequisites**

Before running the application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries.

**Install Dependencies**

Click Load to select an image from your files.

Apply any filters using the buttons.

Adjust brightness using the slider.

Resize the image (optional) by entering width & height.

Click Save to save the processed image.

**Technologies Used**

Python - Programming Language

OpenCV - Image Processing

Tkinter - GUI for user interface

NumPy - Image matrix operations
